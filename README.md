# DoublePendulum
<p>An example of a HSIC (Highly Sensitive to Initial Condition) system</p>
<p>This code shows 5 double pendulums with very little disposition from each other and shows how with time that little difference in initial condition leads to so much difference in behavior</p>
<p>You can save the paths of pendulums colored, by clicking on the window</p>
<p>!!! This code was written in VS, so i recommend checking it there</p>
